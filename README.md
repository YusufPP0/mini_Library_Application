## ðŸš€ Future Improvements and Suggestions

This mini library project is my very first Python project. While it works and provides basic functionality, there are several areas that could be improved or extended in the future:

- **Error Handling:**
  - Currently, input validation is very basic. For example, if a user enters letters instead of numbers for book IDs, the program may crash. Adding robust error handling would make the app more user-friendly.

- **Data Persistence:**
  - Right now, the list of books is stored only in memory, so all data is lost when the program ends. Saving the data to a file (e.g. JSON, CSV, or a database) would be a great next step.

- **Search Functionality:**
  - The `search` function is not implemented yet. It would be useful to allow users to search for books by title, author, or ID.

- **Delete Function:**
  - The delete feature currently removes a book by ID but could benefit from additional checks. For example, confirming with the user before deletion, or handling cases when the book is not found.

- **User Interface:**
  - The program is text-based and runs in the terminal. It could be improved with a simple GUI using libraries like Tkinter or PyQt to make it more user-friendly.

- **Code Structure:**
  - The current code could be organized into classes, using OOP principles (Object-Oriented Programming) for better readability, maintainability, and scalability.

- **Unit Testing:**
  - Adding tests for each function would help ensure the program works correctly as it grows in complexity.

- **Internationalization:**
  - Currently, the app uses only Turkish text for prompts and output. Adding support for multiple languages (e.g. English, Turkish) could make it more versatile.

- **Documentation:**
  - Adding more detailed comments and a more thorough README with usage instructions and examples would be helpful for other developers who might want to use or contribute to the project.

This project has been an excellent learning experience, and I look forward to enhancing it further!
